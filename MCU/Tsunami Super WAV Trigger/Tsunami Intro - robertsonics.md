> # Tsunami
> 
> Tsunami is the next evolutionary step beyond the WAV Trigger.
> 
> Based on a new generation ARM Cortex m7, Tsunami extends polyphony to 32 mono or 18 stereo simultaneous uncompressed 44.1kHz, 16-bit tracks. Each track can start, pause, resume, loop and stop independently, and can have it’s own volume setting, allowing you to create the perfect interactive mix of music, dialog and sound effects.
> 
> The big news is that Tsunami has 8 audio output channels, arranged as either 8 mono or 4 stereo pairs. Alternate versions of firmware support either mono and stereo architecture – you choose. The mono version adds a new “Synced Set” trigger function that can start up to 8 mono tracks on adjacent outputs. These tracks will start and stay in sample-sync for playing stereo or even 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound content with a single trigger.
> 
> Any track can be dynamically routed to any output. And each output provides independent real-time volume and sample-rate conversion (pitch bend.)
> 
> Tsunami also supports true seamless looping over an arbitrary track length.
> 
> Tsunami has a dedicated MIDI port with an integrated opto-isolator, making it easy to connect to any MIDI controller. Tsunami’s MIDI implementation includes control of volume, pitch bend, attack and release times, and the ability to route any MIDI key to any of the output channels, as well as specifying single-shot or looping playback per key.
> 
> IMPORTANT NOTE: Tsunami is a 3.3V device, and its inputs – including triggers and serial RX – are not 5V tolerant!

> **Unique to Tsunami**
> 
> -   32 mono or 18 stereo voice polyphony
> -   Dynamic routing to 8 mono or 4 stereo outputs
> -   Play uncompressed 5.1 or 7.1 surround content with a single trigger
> -   Independent real-time volume and playback rate control per output
> -   Seamless looping over arbitrary track length
> -   Dedicated MIDI I/O

> -   Line-level stereo audio input
> -   Reset button allows changing SD cards without power-cycle
> -   Firmware updates from microSD card. No additional hardware required
> 
> Tsunami supports feature configuration through the use of an “init” text (ASCII) file on the microSD card.  An open-source, cross-platform (Windows, OS X and Linux) utility can create this init file automatically for you using a GUI interface:
