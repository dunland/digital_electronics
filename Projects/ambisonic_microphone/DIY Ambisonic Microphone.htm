    <p><font face="Arial">First off here we probably ought to say a
        little bit about trademarks and patents.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">When I say 'soundfield' I mean soundfield with
        a small s and when I say "Soundfield (tm)" I'm refering to the
        Soundfield (tm) company who produce the exceptionally high
        quality Soundfield (tm) microphone and control unit. All of the
        design data described in this article is freely available in
        published papers.I believe the tetrahedral array has a Michael
        Gerzon patent.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Introduction </font><font face="Arial"> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">A three-dimensional surround sound Ambisonic
        recording can be captured using a tetrahedrally arranged quartet
        of cardioid pattern microphone capsules connected to some simple
        circuitry to convert the outputs to a standard B-format signal.
        B-format signals represent a 3D soundfield with four signals;
        X,Y and Z representing three orthogonal figure of eight patterns
        and an omnidirectional W reference signal. The commercially
        available product is very "high-end" in both quality and price.
        This article describes a lower quality but much cheaper version
        for experimentation. For more info, try a search for ambisonics;
        There is a good page at the university of York.<br>
        UHJ in this instance is a stereo compatible phase matrixed
        method of cramming horizontal surround only B-format W, X and Y
        signals into 2 stereo channels. This can be decoded back into
        B-format W, X and Y for playback into a B-format to speaker feed
        decoder.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Cardioid Pattern Microphone Capsules</font><font face="Arial"> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The most basic requirement for the project is
        for some cheap, fair quality cardioid pattern microphone
        capsules which must be physically small in size. The first
        attempt at this microphone used 6mm diameter capsules made by
        Horn in China which I bought from Mouser in the USA under code
        #252-EM6050U-514. EMU6050U is the Horn part code. These were
        just too noisy even for a cheap microphone.The second attempt
        uses Panasonic WM-56A103. These are 9.5mm modules which have
        higher output and a much better S/N ratio. The performance is
        hardly professional but reaches a level which I think could have
        real practical uses.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The Horn mics claim similar noise performance
        to the Panasonic mics and better low end frequency response. You
        only have to listen to hear that this simply isn't true.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><font face="Arial">The Panasonic WM-55A103 is
          the back electret close relative of the 56A which I also
          bought 10 of, as I was puzzled as to why they were more
          expensive when the others had a seemingly better headline
          specification. I've been told since that this is a higher
          quality unit than the foil electret, so potential constructors
          may choose to go for the WM-55A103 instead. The difference
          between the two is obscured by the idealised frequency
          response chart on the data sheet.</font></font></p>

          mini_soundfield01-01.sch</a></font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Power </font><font face="Arial"> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The circuitry overall runs from +/-9V battery
        supplies. The system will continue working normally right down
        to 6V rails with reduced headroom, so can be run from two 8.4V
        nickel rechargeable PP3 batteries, or can take 9V alkaline
        batteries down to almost full discharge. The mic bias voltage
        comes direct from the +BAT supply and this is filtered heavily
        with the 2K2 -100uF combination. Any noise on this bias supply
        will appear along with the microphone signal so it has to be
        quiet. As the batteries discharge there will be a gradual and
        slight gain reduction but I consider this to be preferable to
        running the mic bias and pre-amp stages from regulated supplies,
        as they have to be quite low voltage to avoid going into
        dropout. Absence of regulators also saves battery current.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Pre-amp stages. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The input noise of the TL074 and other common
        op-amps is too high to be used directly as a microphone pre-amp,
        I tried it. So the circuit shown uses a simple discrete
        transistor differential amplifier connected to an op-amp with
        feedback. This gives low noise from using good quality cheap
        discrete transistors configured to provide some gain, and good
        linearity provided by the high open-loop gain of the op-amp with
        overall feedback. 2N4403 transistors are used running at 250uA
        collector current. That is about the right point for best noise
        performance with 600Ohm to 2K Ohm input impedance. This is
        similar to pre-amplifiers used in some moving-coil phono
        cartridge input stages. You can hear that the microphone capsule
        noise dominates the input stage by replacing it with a 2K2
        resistor and hearing a distinct drop in noise level. The first
        stages provide 21dB gain for each capsule, and there are trims
        on each amplifier to accommodate different sensitivity between
        capsules. For more info on pre-amps look at the Doug Self
        amplifier web-page or buy his interesting book.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Arial">B-format Matrix Stages</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The following stages provide further gain and
        convert the capsule outputs into standard Ambisonic B-format.
        The equations for this are available from various standard
        references but suffice to say that the circuit creates the
        following signals.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Courier">W = -(LFU + LBD + RBU + RFD)</font><br>
      <font face="Courier">X = 2.83( -LFU + LBD + RBU - RFD )</font><br>
      <font face="Courier">Y = 2.83( -LFU - LBD + RBU + RFD )</font><br>
      <font face="Courier">Z = 2.83( -LFU + LBD - RBU + RFD )</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Where LFU, LBD, RBU, RFD are the signals from
        the cardioid pattern capsules facing the directions Left Front
        Up, Left Back Down, Right Back Up, and Right Front Down in the
        tetrahedral array and 2.83 is 2*root2. There is an overall
        inversion in this stage, as there is also in the pre-amp stage.
        This cancels overall.</font></p>

          of ambisonic microphone UHJ encoder mini_soundfield02-01.sch</a></font><font face="Arial"> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">In the dim and distant past a battery powered
        <i>prototype</i> soundfield microphone control box had a UHJ
        encoder included. What a great idea! Well with this design you
        can also record on location direct to UHJ with your stereo
        minidisc recorder, or even your dusty old cassette Pro-Walkman.
        This is ideal for capturing live events where you're not
        intending to do any further mixing on the result, and is in
        keeping with the inexpensive ethic of this design. So here we
        have a built-in UHJ encoder for interfacing to standard stereo
        recorders which are extremely commonplace. <br>
        The UHJ converter is built on a separate board from the A to B
        format converter. The B format signal enters on a 5-way Molex
        connector and goes to the phase shifters. These are based on
        what I think are original Gerzon paper time constants, but I'm
        not sure of the source as I only have a fragment of the full
        document. The circuit is simple and doesn't use the strange
        capacitor values found in the Audio and Design UHJ transcoder
        and decoder. I buy a bunch of good quality capacitors and
        measure the capacitance with my cheapie old multimeter which can
        just about manage 1% precision. Generally I can find plenty
        within 1% out of a bunch of 20 units and this is much cheaper
        than buying 1% versions. This is close enough for me. If I can't
        find enough within 1% then I change the resistor value in the
        time constant to compensate, which is what I've done in the real
        circuit. The filters are 8 pole and cover 30 to 16kHz with
        +/-1.3degrees error assuming perfect components. In real life
        +/-2% is probably closer to reality but this should still
        provide very good operation. The UHJ encoding equations require
        relative 0 and 90 degree versions of W and X signals and just a
        relative 0 degrees for Y. After the phase shifters the signals
        are summed according to the equations below where the j means
        you take the output from the 90 degree shifter.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Courier">Delta = L-R = -j0.3420W +j0.5099X + 0.6555Y</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">so...</font></p>
    <p><font face="Courier">2L = Sigma + Delta = 0.9397W -j0.3420W +
        0.1856X + j0.5099X + 0.6555Y</font></p>
    <p><font face="Courier">2R = Sigma - Delta = 0.9397W +j0.3420W +
        0.1856X - j0.5099X - 0.6555Y</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Now for a mildly interesting point. Creating
        weighted signal sums into the inverting terminal of an op-amp
        with feedback is simple; The ratio of the reciprocal of the
        input resistors simply represents the relative gain that the
        signals into those particular resistors will get. The situation
        on the non-inverting side of the amplifier is a bit more
        complicated, because the +ve terminal is not a virtual GND. When
        you add another input resistor on the +ve side you change the
        gain of all the other inputs on the +ve side. You can, of course
        just sum the signals requiring a +ve polarity into the -ve
        terminal of another amplifier and then feed that into your -ve
        sum. But that wastes an amplifier. As long as you don't want
        more than two inputs to the non-inverting side it is relatively
        easy to work out the resistor values if you remember that the
        non-inverting gain is first set by the feedback resistor and the
        combined input impedance of all the other inputs on the
        inverting side. You work out the normal +G = 1+Ra/Rb to find the
        non-inverting gain which will always be &gt;1. Then,... well it
        gets slightly more complicated and though I did the maths for
        the real values I haven't worked out a general case yet. Suffice
        to say I saved two op-amps with a bit of calculation, and the
        values in the schematics really are correct. The maths gets
        worse with more inputs on the non-inverting side, so here I put
        the more populous signals with an equation + in front into the
        -ve side and the sparser signals in the equations with a - in
        front into the +ve side. The result is just an overall signal
        inversion in both channels which is irrelevant.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">The photograph at the top of the page shows
        the microphone array. The tetrahedron was made from soldered
        together equal length bits of heavy gauge tinned copper wire.
        This is a tricky process but the surface tension of the solder
        blobs at the corners helps a little. The faces of the
        tetrahedron are sized so that the 9.5mm diameter mic capsules
        will just drop through them. The mic capsules are held in the
        faces of the wire tetrahedron with blobs of epoxy as seen in the
        top photograph. The other photgraphs of the whole box and mic
        array show the older smaller Horn mic capsules held in with
        paper. The electrical connections to the mics are made with
        twisted together fine gauge kapton covered wire, and the array
        is supported by a thick gauge copper wire soldered to the array
        and the other end to the GND pin in a five pin XLR. This XLR
        plug forms the main supporting mechanics, and the mic can be
        hand-held by the plug mated with an in-line socket, or by
        plugging it directly into the socket on the pre-amp box. The
        fine wire pointing out to the left in the photograph indicates
        the horizontal front direction.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Non-coincidence compensation filters</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">There aren't any in this design as the
        capsules are very near co-incident anyway. For frequencies below
        8kHz the performance should be quite adequate. I may add these
        later. *(See Footnote)</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">Thanks is due to those on the surround sound
        mailing list who have spotted typographical errors and corrected
        some misconceptions, as well as providing measured data for the
        WM-55 mic capsules and potential sources of higher quality
        capsules.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b>* More About Non-Coincidence Compensation</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Since 2003 I've done a bit more reading about
        this. The clearest information that I found on the subject was a
        scanned copy of some 1970s internal design notes concerning the
        original Soundfield design, I think by Michael Gerzon. This was
        entitled something like "Why you really <i>do</i> need
        non-coincidence compensation," and had hand plotted frequency
        response curves to back it up. My statement above stands, due to
        the small diameter and because I stated 8kHz. as a maximum
        frequency, but it's perhaps a bit dismissive. I ought to have
        ensured that the overall frequency response of the system was
        less than 8kHz. if I was going to be that sweeping.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The problem for me was in the name. If it had
        been called "non-coincidence <i>frequency response</i>
        compensation" I might have looked a bit deeper. What happens is
        that the frequency response of the mic as a whole is different
        in W than it is for X,Y and Z due to the capsule separation.
        Obviously, in each of those outputs it should be the same. From
        memory, when the A format feeds are just summed/differenced in
        the correct ratios to make B-format, the frequency response of
        X,Y and Z changes relative to W when the capsule separation
        becomes a significant fraction of the wavelength. This isn't by
        a trivial amount either, and it can reach 12dB.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">So, if the capsules get bigger and the
        separation rises the frequency at which this matters drops and
        big errors can arise. That's not just some esoteric degradation
        of the surround accuracy; It's a matter of the relative
        frequency responses of the B-format signals going badly wrong.
        So, if you're making a coincident microphone to create B-format
        and don't want to be crucified by the academics, you will want
        to consider this. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">I'm sorry but I can't currently help with
        links to the design information mentioned above, as I was stuck
        in a factory on a laptop when I found it and haven't managed to
        find it since. Analogue implementations are certainly possible,
        but I think that the real signal delays available in DSP make
        the job much easier in digital based A to B conversion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b>Input Op-Amp Taming</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">An engineer from the USA recently found that
        the input stages in this design could oscillate under the
        conditions in his system. True, the TL07x can get a bit lively
        dependant on the load, so in audio applications it's best to add
        a low value capacitor between the output and the non-inverting
        input of most instances of those amplifiers, say 15pF.<br>
